  abstract = {Representation of generalized additive models (GAM's) using penalized regression splines allows GAM's to be employed in a straightforward manner using penalized regression methods. Not only is inference facilitated by this approach, but it is also possible to integrate model selection in the form of smoothing parameter selection into model fitting in a computationally efficient manner using well founded criteria such as generalized cross-validation. The current fitting and smoothing parameter selection methods for such models are usually effective, but do not provide the level of numerical stability to which users of linear regression packages, for example, are accustomed. In particular the existing methods cannot deal adequately with numerical rank deficiency of the GAM fitting problem, and it is not straightforward to produce methods that can do so, given that the degree of rank deficiency can be smoothing parameter dependent. In addition, models with the potential flexibility of GAM's can also present practical fitting difficulties as a result of indeterminacy in the model likelihood: Data with many zeros fitted by a model with a log link are a good example. In this article it is proposed that GAM's with a ridge penalty provide a practical solution in such circumstances, and a multiple smoothing parameter selection method suitable for use in the presence of such a penalty is developed. The method is based on the pivoted QR decomposition and the singular value decomposition, so that with or without a ridge penalty it has good error propagation properties and is capable of detecting and coping elegantly with numerical rank deficiency. The method also allows mixtures of user specified and estimated smoothing parameters and the setting of lower bounds on smoothing parameters. In terms of computational efficiency, the method compares well with existing methods. A simulation study compares the method to existing methods, including treating GAM's as mixed models.},

  abstract = {The quantification of transmissibility during epidemics is essential to designing and adjusting public health responses. Transmissibility can be measured by the reproduction number R, the average number of secondary cases caused by an infected individual. Several methods have been proposed to estimate R over the course of an epidemic; however, they are usually difficult to implement for people without a strong background in statistical modeling. Here, we present a ready-to-use tool for estimating R from incidence time series, which is implemented in popular software including Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). This tool produces novel, statistically robust analytical estimates of R and incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of the serial interval (the time between the onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of symptoms in secondary cases). We applied the method to 5 historical outbreaks; the resulting estimates of R are consistent with those presented in the literature. This tool should help epidemiologists quantify temporal changes in the transmission intensity of future epidemics by using surveillance data.},

In addition, it offers easy access to parallel computations. The user defines the joint likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects (≈ 106 ) and parameters (≈ 103 ). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org/.},

Two versions of the Akaike information criterion, AIC, have been used, based either on the marginal or on the conditional distribution. We show that the marginal AIC is not an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the Akaike information, and favours smaller models without random effects. For the conditional AIC, we show that ignoring estimation uncertainty in the random effects covariance matrix, as is common practice, induces a bias that can lead to the selection of any random effect not predicted to be exactly zero. We derive an analytic representation of a corrected version of the conditional AIC, which avoids the high computational cost and imprecision of available numerical approximations. An implementation in an R package (R Development Core Team, 2010) is provided. All theoretical results are illustrated in simulation studies, and their impact in practice is investigated in an analysis of childhood malnutrition in Zambia.},

Analyses of new variants have primarily focused on characterizing changes in the proportion of new variants, implicitly or explicitly assuming that the relative speed remains fixed over the course of an invasion. We use a generation-interval-based framework to challenge this assumption and illustrate how relative strength and speed change over time under two idealized interventions: a constant-strength intervention like idealized vaccination or social distancing, which reduces transmission rates by a constant proportion, and a constant-speed intervention like idealized contact tracing, which isolates infected individuals at a constant rate. In general, constant-strength interventions change the relative speed of a new variant, while constant-speed interventions change its relative strength. Differences in the generation-interval distributions between variants can exaggerate these changes and modify the effectiveness of interventions. Finally, neglecting differences in generation-interval distributions can bias estimates of relative strength.},
